# loraGo

This code uses an FTDI adapter to speak SPI to lora modules I was using for a project that would have detected high water a couple miles away. I moved away since and this code likely won't be used anymore :/ 

Take note of the radio regulations around LoRa for your locale. I was only allowed to use 430 mhz because I have a ham radio license. It's likely you'll have to use the 800 mhz variant instead, especially if you're not a licensed radio amateur
